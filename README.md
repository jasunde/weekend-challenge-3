# Weekend Challenge 3

Welcome to your third weekend challenge!
We are going to be building a calculator application using jQuery, Node, and Express, all hosted on Heroku!

## Server Logic & Client Functionality
**IMPORTANT**: The logic for the calculator needs to be housed on the **Server**.

The **Client** will take in the values (via 2 _input_ fields) and the type of mathematical operation (selected using a _button_ on the DOM). Each numerical value and the mathematical operator type will be bundled up in an object and then sent to the server via a _POST_ request. So when the object leaves the **Client**, it should look something like this:

```javascript
{
   x: 3,
   y: 4,
   type: "Add"
}
```

Once the **Server** receives it, create the logic to compute the numbers in 1 of 4 different ways: The server should be able to handle (1) addition, (2) subtraction, (3) multiplication, and (4) division. Once the result of the mathematical operation is determined, it should be sent back down to the **Client** where it will be displayed on the DOM.

Finally, build a `clear` button that resets the whole experience.

## HARD MODE

Convert the input fields for the two values to buttons. This experience would allow the user to

1. click on a numerical button
2. click on a mathematical operator
3. click on a numerical button
4. click on an equal button that sends all of the information to the server

## PRO MODE

Style the whole experience using Bootstrap to resemble the design of a physical calculator. Then, include decimal points in your number logic. Finally, convert your logic to have the **Client** handle which mathematical operation is run. Once it determines this, it will use that to change the URL or the POST request to pair with a **Server** route that handles that type of mathematical operation.

For example, the **Client** code might look like this

```javascript
$.ajax({

    type: "POST",

    url: "/division",

    success: function(data){

       //something here

    }

});
```

and the **Server** code would have something like

```javascript
router.post('/division', function(req, res){

  //some code here

});
```
